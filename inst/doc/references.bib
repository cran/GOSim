	environments in crystal data have been developed for the description
	of interaction properties of small molecules. Using SuperStar seven
	diverse probe atoms have been selected to reflect the most important
	physicochemical properties. The general application of these descriptors
	in comparative molecular field analysis has been investigated using
	a dataset of thermolysin inhibitors, and a comparison to the GRID
	program has been performed. We especially focused on hydrogen-bond
	donor and acceptor properties by selecting a carbonyl and amino group
	as suitable probes. Their performance has been compared to that of
	the hydrogen-bond descriptors presently implemented in CoMSIA (comparative
	molecular similarity indices analysis). The newly developed descriptors
	produced significantly improved statistics for the correlation analyses
	if they are exclusively applied or, even better, applied in c ombination
	with other CoMSIA descriptors. Two methodologically different approaches
	have been tested to approximate the developed descriptors. Both reduce
	significantly the required computational efforts in particular for
	large data sets. The graphical interpretation of the field contributions
	of hydrogen-bonding properties elucidates additional features compared
	to those obtained from the original CoMSIA method. They are of valuable
	support for the design of improved inhibitors.},

	In contrast to many other wrapper methods it is fully deterministic
	and computationally efficient. We compare our method to existing

	classification data set and the Huuskonen regression data set for
	aqueous solubility.}

	in drug development, it has become widely appreciated that these
	areas should be considered as early as possible in the drug discovery
	process. However, in recent years, combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput
	screening have significantly increased the number of compounds for
	which early data on absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion
	(ADME) and toxicity (T) are needed, which has in turn driven the
	develop-ment of a variety of medium and high-throughput in vitro
	ADMET screens. Here, we describe how in silico approaches will further
	increase our ability to predict and model the most relevant pharma-cokinetic,
