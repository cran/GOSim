	physicochemical properties. The general application of these descriptors
	in comparative molecular field analysis has been investigated using
	a dataset of thermolysin inhibitors, and a comparison to the GRID
	program has been performed. We especially focused on hydrogen-bond
	donor and acceptor properties by selecting a carbonyl and amino group

	the hydrogen-bond descriptors presently implemented in CoMSIA (comparative
	molecular similarity indices analysis). The newly developed descriptors
	produced significantly improved statistics for the correlation analyses
	if they are exclusively applied or, even better, applied in c ombination
	with other CoMSIA descriptors. Two methodologically different approaches
	have been tested to approximate the developed descriptors. Both reduce
	significantly the required computational efforts in particular for
	large data sets. The graphical interpretation of the field contributions
	of hydrogen-bonding properties elucidates additional features compared
	to those obtained from the original CoMSIA method. They are of valuable
	support for the design of improved inhibitors.},

  abstract = {Tom34 is a newly-found component of the mitochondrial protein import
	machinery in mammalian cells with no apparent counterpart in fungi.
	RNA blot and immunoblot analyses showed that the expression of Tom34
	varies among tissues and differs from that of the core translocase
	component Tom20. In contrast to a previous report [Nuttal, S.D. et
	al. (1997) DNA Cell Biol. 16, 1067-1074], the present study using
	a newly-prepared anti-Tom34 antibody with a high titer showed that
	Tom34 is present largely in the cytosolic fraction and partly in
	the mitochondrial and membrane fractions after fractionation of tissues
	and cells, and that the membrane-associated form is largely extractable
	with 0.1 M sodium carbonate. The in vitro import of preproteins into
	isolated rat mitochondria was strongly inhibited by DeltahTom34 which
	lacks the NH2-terminal hydrophobic region of human Tom34 (hTom34).
	Import was also strongly inhibited by anti-hTom34. In pulse-chase
	experiments using COS-7 cells, pre-ornithine transcarbamylase (pOTC)
	was rapidly processed to the mature form. Coexpression of hTom34
	resulted in a stimulation of pOTC processing, whereas the coexpression
	of hTom34 antisense RNA caused inhibition. The results confirm that
	Tom34 plays a role in mitochondrial protein import in mammals, and
	suggest it to be an ancillary component of the translocation machinery
	in mammalian cells.},

  abstract = {The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions
	for human physiology, as well as rich information about human evolution.
	In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported
	a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome.
	Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert
	this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete
	coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The
	current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides
	interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers approximately 99\% of the
	euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of approximately
	1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps
	are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused
	work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for
	a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses
	of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death.
	Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000-25,000 protein-coding
	genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation
	for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

  abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput technologies now allow the acquisition
	of biological data such as comprehensive biochemical time-courses
	at unprecedented rates. These temporal profiles carry topological
	and kinetic information regarding the biochemical network from which
	they were drawn. Retrieving this information will require systematic
	application of both experimental and computational methods.Results:
	S-systems are non-linear mathematical approximative models based
	on the power-law formalism. They provide a general framework for
	the simulation of integrated biological systems exhibiting complex
	dynamics such as genetic circuits, signal transduction and metabolic
	networks. We describe how the heuristic optimization technique Simulated
	Annealing can be effectively used for estimating the parameters of
	S-systems from time-course biochemical data. We demonstrate our methods
	using 3 artificial networks designed to simulate different network
	topologies and behavior. We then end with an application to a real
	biochemical network by creating a working model for the cadBA system
	in E. coli.Availability: The source code written in C++ is available

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {3},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput technologies like functional screens and
	gene expression analysis produce extended lists of candidate genes.
	Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis is a commonly used and well established
	technique to test for the statistically significant over-representation
	of particular pathways. A shortcoming of this method is however,
	that most genes that are investigated in the experiments have very
	sparse functional or pathway annotation and therefore cannot be the
	target of such an analysis. The approach presented here aims to assign
	lists of genes with limited annotation to previously described functional
	gene collections or pathways. This works by comparing InterPro domain
	signatures of the candidate gene lists with domain signatures of
	gene sets derived from known classifications, e.g. KEGG pathways.
	RESULTS: In order to validate our approach, we designed a simulation
	study. Based on all pathways available in the KEGG database, we create
	test gene lists by randomly selecting pathway genes, removing these
	genes from the known pathways and adding variable amounts of noise
	in the form of genes not annotated to the pathway. We show that we
	can recover pathway memberships based on the simulated gene lists
	with high accuracy. We further demonstrate the applicability of our
	approach on a biological example. CONCLUSION: Results based on simulation
	and data analysis show that domain based pathway enrichment analysis
	is a very sensitive method to test for enrichment of pathways in
	sparsely annotated lists of genes. An R based software package domainsignatures,
	to routinely perform this analysis on the results of high-throughput
	screening, is available via Bioconductor.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Cluster analysis of genome-wide expression data from DNA
	microarray hybridization studies has proved to be a useful tool for
	identifying biologically relevant groupings of genes and samples.
	In the present paper, we focus on several important issues related
	to clustering algorithms that have not yet been fully studied. Results:
	We describe a simple and robust algorithm for the clustering of temporal
	gene expression profiles that is based on the simulated annealing
	procedure. In general, this algorithm guarantees to eventually find
	the globally optimal distribution of genes over clusters. We introduce
	an iterative scheme that serves to evaluate quantitatively the optimal
	number of clusters for each specific data set. The scheme is based
	on standard approaches used in regular statistical tests. The basic
	idea is to organize the search of the optimal number of clusters
	simultaneously with the optimization of the distribution of genes
	over clusters. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been
	evaluated by means of a reverse engineering experiment, that is,
	a situation in which the correct distribution of genes over clusters
	is known a priori. The employment of this statistically rigorous
	test has shown that our algorithm places greater than 90% genes into
	correct clusters. Finally, the algorithm has been tested on real
	gene expression data (expression changes during yeast cell cycle)
	for which the fundamental patterns of gene expression and the assignment
	of genes to clusters are well understood from numerous previous studies.
	Availability: The source code of the program implementing the algorithm
	is available upon request from the authors. Contact: alex_lukashin@biogen.com},

  volume = {9},
  pages = {327},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of various high-throughput experimental
	and computational methods allows biologists to rapidly infer functional
	relationships between genes. It is often necessary to evaluate these
	predictions computationally, a task that requires a reference database
	for functional relatedness. One such reference is the Gene Ontology
	(GO). A number of groups have suggested that the semantic similarity
	of the GO annotations of genes can serve as a proxy for functional
	relatedness. Here we evaluate a simple measure of semantic similarity,
	term overlap (TO). RESULTS: We computed the TO for randomly selected
	gene pairs from the mouse genome. For comparison, we implemented
	six previously reported semantic similarity measures that share the
	feature of using computation of probabilities of terms to infer information
	content, in addition to three vector based approaches and a normalized
	version of the TO measure. We find that the overlap measure is highly
	correlated with the others but differs in detail. TO is at least
	as good a predictor of sequence similarity as the other measures.
	We further show that term overlap may avoid some problems that affect
	the probability-based measures. Term overlap is also much faster
	to compute than the information content-based measures. CONCLUSION:
	Our experiments suggest that term overlap can serve as a simple and
	fast alternative to other approaches which use explicit information
	content estimation or require complex pre-calculations, while also
	avoiding problems that some other measures may encounter.},

  title = {Defining functional distances over gene ontology.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {50},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A fundamental problem when trying to define the functional
	relationships between proteins is the difficulty in quantifying functional
	similarities, even when well-structured ontologies exist regarding
	the activity of proteins (i.e. 'gene ontology' -GO-). However, functional
	metrics can overcome the problems in the comparing and evaluating
	functional assignments and predictions. As a reference of proximity,
	previous approaches to compare GO terms considered linkage in terms
	of ontology weighted by a probability distribution that balances
	the non-uniform 'richness' of different parts of the Direct Acyclic
	Graph. Here, we have followed a different approach to quantify functional
	similarities between GO terms. RESULTS: We propose a new method to
	derive 'functional distances' between GO terms that is based on the
	simultaneous occurrence of terms in the same set of Interpro entries,
	instead of relying on the structure of the GO. The coincidence of
	GO terms reveals natural biological links between the GO functions
	and defines a distance model Df which fulfils the properties of a
	Metric Space. The distances obtained in this way can be represented
	as a hierarchical 'Functional Tree'. CONCLUSION: The method proposed
	provides a new definition of distance that enables the similarity
	between GO terms to be quantified. Additionally, the 'Functional
	Tree' defines groups with biological meaning enhancing its utility
	for protein function comparison and prediction. Finally, this approach
	could be for function-based protein searches in databases, and for
	analysing the gene clusters produced by DNA array experiments.},

	from indirect regulatory effects from an interaction graph built
	up by error-prone measurements. Many of these algorithms can be cast
	as a rule for the removal of a single edge of the graph, such that
	the remaining graph is still consistent with the data. A set of mild
	conditions is given under which iterated application of such a rule
	leads to a unique minimal consistent graph. We show that three of
	the common methods for direct interactions search fulfill these conditions,
	thus providing a justification of their use. The main issues a reconstruction
	algorithm has to deal with, are the noise in the data, the presence
	of regulatory cycles, and the direction of the regulatory effects.
	We introduce a novel rule that, in contrast to the previously mentioned
	methods, simultaneously takes into account all these aspects. An
	efficient algorithm for the computation of the minimal graph is given,
	whose time complexity is cubic in the number of vertices of the graph.
	Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method in a simulation
	study.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The standard L(2)-norm support vector machine (SVM) is
	a widely used tool for microarray classification. Previous studies
	have demonstrated its superior performance in terms of classification
	accuracy. However, a major limitation of the SVM is that it cannot
	automatically select relevant genes for the classification. The L(1)-norm
	SVM is a variant of the standard L(2)-norm SVM, that constrains the
	L(1)-norm of the fitted coefficients. Due to the singularity of the
	L(1)-norm, the L(1)-norm SVM has the property of automatically selecting
	relevant genes. On the other hand, the L(1)-norm SVM has two drawbacks:
	(1) the number of selected genes is upper bounded by the size of
	the training data; (2) when there are several highly correlated genes,
	the L(1)-norm SVM tends to pick only a few of them, and remove the
	rest. RESULTS: We propose a hybrid huberized support vector machine
	(HHSVM). The HHSVM combines the huberized hinge loss function and
	the elastic-net penalty. By doing so, the HHSVM performs automatic
	gene selection in a way similar to the L(1)-norm SVM. In addition,
	the HHSVM encourages highly correlated genes to be selected (or removed)
	together. We also develop an efficient algorithm to compute the entire
	solution path of the HHSVM. Numerical results indicate that the HHSVM
	tends to provide better variable selection results than the L(1)-norm
	SVM, especially when variables are highly correlated. AVAILABILITY:
	R code are available at http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jizhu/code/hhsvm/.},

	in drug development, it has become widely appreciated that these
	areas should be considered as early as possible in the drug discovery
	process. However, in recent years, combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput
	screening have significantly increased the number of compounds for
	which early data on absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion
	(ADME) and toxicity (T) are needed, which has in turn driven the

	transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) we have identified a human TR4 mRNA (hTR4alpha2)
	that is analogous in size and sequence to the reported rat TR4. RT-PCR
	analysis using total RNA derived from various rat tissues revealed
	a new rat TR4 transcript, referred to as rTR4alpha1, which is homologous
	to hTR4alpha1 since it contains the extra 19 amino acids in the A/B
	region. The two rat transcripts showed a differential tissue distribution.
	Analysis of the exon-intron organization of the hTR4 A/B region showed
	that the 19-amino-acid peptide insert in hTR4alpha1 was encoded by
	a separate exon, indicating that hTR4alpha1 and hTR4alpha2 transcripts
	were produced by the differential usage of the exon. RT-PCR analysis
	revealed that both hTR4alpha1 and hTR4alpha2 were detectable in brain,
	placenta, and ovary. In contrast, the human ovarian cancer cell line,
	PA1, failed to express hTR4alpha1. By fluorescence in situ hybridization,
	we have mapped the hTR4 gene to 3p25, a region deleted in some forms
	of cancer.},
